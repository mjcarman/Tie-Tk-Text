Revision history for Tie-Tk-Text

0.92 (2009-01-20)
    - Updated documentation to reflect that this works for any Tk-based
      text widget (e.g. Tkx::ROText).
    - Use Module::Build for installation. ExtUtils::MakeMaker can still be used 
      as well.

0.91 (2006-11-29)
    - Added Tk as a prerequisite so that the automated testers pick up 
      on it. (The module itself doesn't use Tk but it serves no purpose
      without it.)

0.90 (2006-11-21)
    - provides all methods for tied arrays (note: EXTEND is a no-op)

0.01 (2006-11-19)
    - original version released on CPAN; provides *readonly* access
